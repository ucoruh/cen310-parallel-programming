This project will test your skills in software engineering, object-oriented programming, understanding and application of UML diagrams, and effective team collaboration. You'll start by using a provided Java Maven template for your project setup, adhering to a comprehensive list of development, documentation, and testing standards to ensure a robust application.</p> <p>Structured Task Breakdown</p> <p>1. Team Formation and Project Selection</p> <ul> <li>Form Teams: Collaboratively form your teams based on the course guidelines. Diversity in team composition is encouraged.</li> <li>Select a Project: Choose a unique application from the course's appendix list. Ensure your selection differs from your peers to avoid overlaps and potential plagiarism. Also, you shouldn't select same topics from previous terms and lectures.</li> <li>Justification: Document why you chose your specific project, focusing on what software engineering and OOP concepts you anticipate learning or applying.</li> </ul> <p>2. Project Setup and Repository Management</p> <ul> <li>Fork and Rename Repository: Fork the Java Maven template provided at GitHub - ucoruh/eclipse-java-maven-template: Maven (Build,Test,Coverage,Publish) + Doxygen (HTML, Latex, RTF) + ReportGenerator + QA (Test Coverage) + Astyle Template. Rename your repository following the pattern ce204-hw-name-surname-java to maintain consistency and organization.</li> <li>Privacy Setting: Your repository should be set to private, ensuring only team members and your instructor have access.</li> </ul> <p>3. Application Development</p> <ul> <li>Console Application Design: Develop a console application, ensuring the core functionality is modularized in a separate library. Depending on project requirements, incorporate binary file storage or mock-ups for simulating network communications.</li> <li>Interface Design: Craft a user-friendly console interface that supports navigation through keyboard inputs (e.g., arrows, tabs).</li> <li>Object-Oriented Architecture: Design your application following solid object-oriented principles. Your code should demonstrate a clear understanding of classes, objects, inheritance, and polymorphism.</li> </ul> <p>4. OOP Requirements and Principles</p> <ul> <li>Class Hierarchy: Implement a meaningful class hierarchy that demonstrates proper inheritance relationships. Your classes should have clearly defined parent-child relationships where appropriate.</li> <li>Encapsulation: Apply proper encapsulation techniques by using access modifiers (private, protected, public) appropriately. Data should be hidden within classes and accessed through getter and setter methods.</li> <li>Polymorphism: Demonstrate polymorphic behavior through method overriding and/or method overloading. Include examples of runtime polymorphism where appropriate.</li> <li>Abstraction: Use abstract classes and/or interfaces to define common behaviors and enforce contracts between classes.</li> <li>Design Patterns: Implement at least two design patterns (e.g., Singleton, Factory, Observer, Strategy) that are appropriate for your application's requirements.</li> <li>SOLID Principles: Apply SOLID principles (Single Responsibility, Open/Closed, Liskov Substitution, Interface Segregation, Dependency Inversion) in your code design.</li> </ul> <p>5. UML Design and Documentation</p> <ul> <li>UML Diagrams: Utilize PlantUML to create detailed UML diagrams (class, sequence, and use cases) that illustrate your application's design and workflow.</li> <li>Class Diagrams: Create comprehensive class diagrams showing all classes, their attributes, methods, and relationships (inheritance, association, aggregation, composition).</li> <li>Sequence Diagrams: Develop sequence diagrams to illustrate the interactions between objects in your application for key use cases.</li> <li>Design Justification: Explain your design choices, focusing on how they embody OOP principles like encapsulation, inheritance, polymorphism, and abstraction.</li> </ul> <p>6. Collaboration, Documentation, and Testing</p> <ul> <li>Team Collaboration: Use GitHub for all aspects of team collaboration. This includes branching, committing, merging, and resolving conflicts. Ensure to commit regularly to accurately reflect each team member's contributions.</li> <li>Documentation: Use Doxygen for documenting both the application and the library. Aim for 100% documentation coverage. Documentation should include:</li> <li>Class descriptions (purpose and functionality)</li> <li>Method descriptions (parameters, return values, exceptions)</li> <li>Relationship explanations (why certain inheritance or composition relationships exist)</li> <li>Design pattern implementations</li> <li>Testing: Develop comprehensive unit tests for all functionalities, striving for 100% test coverage. Tests should verify that:</li> <li>Classes function correctly individually</li> <li>Inheritance relationships work as expected</li> <li>Polymorphic behavior produces correct results</li> <li>Design patterns are implemented correctly</li> </ul> <p>7. Finalization and Submission</p> <ul> <li>Presentation: Prepare a concise presentation deck (up to 10 slides) and a video presentation (up to 4 minutes) that summarizes the project's architecture, functionality, and key learning points.</li> <li>Code and Documentation Submission: Ensure your code is well-commented, adheres to the coding standards, and is thoroughly tested on both WSL/Linux and Windows OS. Submit a detailed project report and the source code named ce204-hw-name-surname.rar, containing the GitHub cloned templates.</li> </ul> <p>8. Additional Requirements and Integrity</p> <ul> <li>Originality: Maintain originality in your work. Use of plagiarism detection software is encouraged to ensure the uniqueness of your code.</li> <li>External Tools: The use of tools like ChatGPT for project development or documentation should be carefully considered to maintain the authenticity of your work.</li> </ul> <p>9. OOP-Specific Evaluation Criteria</p> <p>Your project will be evaluated based on the following OOP-specific criteria:</p> <ul> <li>Class Design: How well your classes are designed (cohesion, coupling, granularity)</li> <li>Inheritance Implementation: Appropriate use of inheritance, avoiding unnecessary inheritance relationships</li> <li>Polymorphism Usage: Effective use of polymorphism to simplify code and improve extensibility</li> <li>Abstraction Quality: Appropriate use of abstract classes and interfaces</li> <li>Encapsulation Practice: Proper hiding of implementation details and data protection</li> <li>Design Pattern Implementation: Correct implementation of design patterns and explanation of why they were chosen</li> <li>Code Reusability: How reusable and modular your code components are</li> <li>Exception Handling: Proper implementation of exception handling for robust code</li> </ul> <p>10. Best Practices and Standards</p> <ul> <li>Adhere strictly to coding standards, file management, code aesthetics, and ensure the application's cross-platform compatibility.</li> <li>Engage in DevOps practices as applicable to Java projects, including creating releases according to the project's needs.</li> <li>Follow Java naming conventions for classes, methods, variables, and packages.</li> <li>Properly organize your code into packages that reflect the application's domain and architecture.</li> </ul> <p>Conclusion and Encouragement</p> <p>This project is an opportunity to apply theoretical knowledge in a practical setting, enhancing your software engineering and OOP skills. It's also a chance to experience real-world development processes, from initial design to final presentation. Remember, the grading rubric and further details are available on Microsoft Teams.
